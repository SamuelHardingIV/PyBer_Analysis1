# Overview #
## Purpose ##

The purpose for this analysis is to get a breakdown per week on what type of city fares or higher or lower. Also, in what area we should target in the near future for higher profits out of the three cities types: urban rural and suburban areas.

## Results ##
	After hours of deep diving through raw data, our analysis is that in the urban area fares are ~80% more than rural areas and 60% more than the suburban areas. In conclusion, the urban areas should have the higher count of drivers so that the company continue to make high profits.

## Summary ##
	I believe that the CEO should target urban areas for higher profit return which will also give the CEO a higher bonus.
